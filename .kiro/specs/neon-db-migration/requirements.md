# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the migration from SQLite to Neon DB (PostgreSQL) for the SwiftShip package tracking system deployed on Netlify. The migration aims to improve scalability, reliability, and performance by leveraging a cloud-native PostgreSQL database that better supports serverless environments.

## Glossary

- **Neon_DB**: A serverless PostgreSQL database service optimized for modern applications
- **SwiftShip_System**: The package tracking web application currently deployed on Netlify
- **Migration_Process**: The systematic conversion from SQLite to PostgreSQL database
- **Database_Schema**: The structure of tables, indexes, and relationships in the database
- **Connection_Pool**: A cache of database connections to improve performance in serverless environments
- **Environment_Variables**: Configuration values stored securely in Netlify's environment settings

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate from SQLite to Neon DB, so that the application can handle concurrent users and scale reliably in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete, THE SwiftShip_System SHALL connect to Neon_DB instead of SQLite
2. THE SwiftShip_System SHALL maintain all existing functionality after migration
3. THE SwiftShip_System SHALL preserve all existing data during migration
4. THE SwiftShip_System SHALL use connection pooling for optimal serverless performance
5. WHERE connection failures occur, THE SwiftShip_System SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want PostgreSQL-compatible database operations, so that I can leverage advanced database features and better performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SwiftShip_System SHALL use PostgreSQL-compatible SQL syntax for all database operations
2. THE SwiftShip_System SHALL implement proper PostgreSQL data types for all columns
3. THE SwiftShip_System SHALL use PostgreSQL indexes for query optimization
4. THE SwiftShip_System SHALL handle PostgreSQL-specific error codes and messages
5. THE SwiftShip_System SHALL use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want secure database configuration, so that sensitive credentials are properly managed in the Netlify environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SwiftShip_System SHALL store database credentials as Netlify environment variables
2. THE SwiftShip_System SHALL use SSL connections to Neon_DB
3. THE SwiftShip_System SHALL validate environment variables on startup
4. THE SwiftShip_System SHALL provide clear error messages for configuration issues
5. WHERE environment variables are missing, THE SwiftShip_System SHALL fail gracefully with descriptive errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an end user, I want uninterrupted service during migration, so that I can continue tracking packages without downtime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Migration_Process SHALL preserve all existing package data
2. THE Migration_Process SHALL preserve all status update history
3. THE Migration_Process SHALL preserve all contact submissions
4. THE Migration_Process SHALL maintain data integrity throughout the process
5. THE SwiftShip_System SHALL provide data validation after migration completion

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive health monitoring, so that I can verify the database migration was successful and monitor ongoing performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE SwiftShip_System SHALL provide health check endpoints for Neon_DB connectivity
2. THE SwiftShip_System SHALL monitor connection pool status and performance
3. THE SwiftShip_System SHALL log database operation metrics
4. THE SwiftShip_System SHALL provide diagnostic information for troubleshooting
5. WHERE database issues occur, THE SwiftShip_System SHALL provide actionable error messages
