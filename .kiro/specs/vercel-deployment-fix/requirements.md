# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the 404 NOT_FOUND error occurring after deploying the SwiftShip package tracking application to Vercel. The system currently returns a "404: NOT_FOUND Code: NOT_FOUND ID: cpt1::zx7q8-1760969974878-97e4ff5a8c28" response when accessing the deployed domain. Based on analysis of the project structure, this appears to be related to Next.js routing configuration, SQLite3 database handling in serverless environment, or missing environment variables required for the application to function properly.

## Glossary

- **Vercel_Platform**: The cloud platform hosting the Next.js application with serverless functions
- **SwiftShip_Application**: The package tracking web application built with Next.js, featuring pages for tracking, admin, and contact
- **Deployment_Configuration**: The vercel.json and next.config.js files that control build and routing behavior
- **Build_Process**: The compilation and optimization steps that prepare the application for production
- **Routing_System**: The Next.js file-based routing system that maps URLs to pages and API endpoints
- **Environment_Variables**: Configuration values including database path, authentication secrets, and admin credentials
- **Database_System**: SQLite3 database with initialization and health check functionality
- **API_Endpoints**: Server-side functions including /api/track, /api/contact, /api/health, and admin routes

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the deployed SwiftShip application, I want to access the homepage successfully, so that I can use the package tracking functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the root domain, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL serve the homepage without returning a 404 error
2. THE SwiftShip_Application SHALL load all static assets (CSS, JavaScript, images) correctly from the deployed environment
3. THE Routing_System SHALL properly handle all defined routes including /admin, /track, and /contact pages
4. IF a user accesses a non-existent route, THEN THE SwiftShip_Application SHALL display a proper 404 page instead of a platform error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer deploying the application, I want the build process to complete successfully, so that all application features are available in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Build_Process SHALL compile all TypeScript files without errors
2. THE Build_Process SHALL generate all necessary static files and pages including index, track, contact, and admin pages
3. THE Deployment_Configuration SHALL properly configure Next.js for the Vercel serverless environment
4. THE Build_Process SHALL handle SQLite3 dependencies correctly for serverless functions
5. THE Database_System SHALL initialize properly in the serverless environment without file system conflicts
6. WHEN the build completes, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL have all required files available for serving

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all environment variables to be properly configured, so that the application can connect to required services and authenticate users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Environment_Variables SHALL be properly set in the Vercel dashboard for production deployment
2. THE SwiftShip_Application SHALL access database connections using the configured DATABASE_PATH
3. THE SwiftShip_Application SHALL authenticate admin users using ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD variables
4. THE SwiftShip_Application SHALL use NEXTAUTH_URL and NEXTAUTH_SECRET for session management
5. IF any required Environment_Variables are missing, THEN THE SwiftShip_Application SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the API endpoints, I want all API routes to function correctly, so that I can perform package tracking operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Routing_System SHALL properly route requests to /api/track, /api/contact, /api/health, and /api/admin/* endpoints
2. THE SwiftShip_Application SHALL handle CORS headers correctly for API requests
3. THE Database_System SHALL initialize successfully on first API request without blocking subsequent requests
4. THE API_Endpoints SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages for all responses
5. THE SwiftShip_Application SHALL handle database operations in serverless functions without file system permission errors
6. WHEN API endpoints are accessed, THE Vercel_Platform SHALL execute serverless functions within the 30-second timeout limit

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the health check endpoint to work properly, so that I can monitor the application status and diagnose issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API_Endpoints SHALL provide a functional /api/health endpoint for system monitoring
2. THE Database_System SHALL report connection status accurately through the health check
3. THE SwiftShip_Application SHALL return detailed error information when database connections fail
4. THE Vercel_Platform SHALL serve the health endpoint without authentication requirements
5. WHEN the health endpoint is accessed, THE SwiftShip_Application SHALL respond within 5 seconds with system status
