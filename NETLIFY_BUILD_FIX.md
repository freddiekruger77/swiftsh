# Netlify Build Fix - Resolved

## 🐛 Issue
Netlify deployment failed with error: **"Missing script: 'build:netlify'"**

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Updated netlify.toml
Changed build command from `npm run build:netlify` to `npm run build`:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "out"
  command = "npm run build"  # ← Fixed: was "npm run build:netlify"
```

### 2. Added Backup Script
Added `build:netlify` as an alias in package.json for compatibility:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "next build && npm run build:functions",
    "build:netlify": "npm run build",  # ← Added as alias
    "build:functions": "node scripts/build-netlify-functions.js"
  }
}
```

### 3. Updated Documentation
Fixed all references in documentation files:
- `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `NETLIFY_CHECKLIST.md` 
- `NETLIFY_RESTRUCTURE_SUMMARY.md`

## 🧪 Testing Results

### ✅ Local Build Test
```bash
npm run build
✓ Static site generation: SUCCESS
✓ Netlify functions: 12 functions created
✓ Output: out/ + netlify/functions/
```

### ✅ Alias Test
```bash
npm run build:netlify
✓ Runs npm run build successfully
✓ All functions generated correctly
```

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

### Correct Netlify Configuration
- **Build command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish directory**: `out`
- **Functions directory**: `netlify/functions`
- **Node version**: 18

### Environment Variables Required
```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-site.netlify.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-32-character-secret
DATABASE_PATH=/tmp/swiftship.db
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@swiftship.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
NODE_ENV=production
```

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Commit these fixes** to your repository
2. **Trigger new Netlify deployment** (should work now)
3. **Verify build succeeds** in Netlify dashboard
4. **Test deployed site** functionality

## 🔍 What Was Wrong

The issue occurred because during the Vercel cleanup, we removed the `build:netlify` script from package.json but forgot to update the `netlify.toml` configuration file that was still referencing it.

## ✅ Resolution

- ✅ Fixed netlify.toml build command
- ✅ Added backup script for compatibility
- ✅ Updated all documentation
- ✅ Tested both build commands locally
- ✅ Ready for successful Netlify deployment

**The deployment should now work correctly! 🎉**
